I created three levels with score system, enemies and traps, and the player can destory the enemies with a combat system by clicking right mouse button. 
I created a cpin system that allows player get points by walking through them. 
I also created a weapon system that allows the player to pick up different weapons, pressing E key makes player pick up and Q key makes player drop. And it has 5 slots that allows the player to pick up 5 weapons. and the player can switch them by pressing number keys. Key 1 represents slot one and key 5 represents slot 5.
The NPC at the beginning tells player what to do, and press F key to start conversation.
